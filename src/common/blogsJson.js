      post1: `Becoming an entrepreneur had always been my dream.

      I mean, everyone wants to be their own boss, right? If not for anything else, at least to avoid an entirely begrudging career, working for “THE BOSS”. For this reason, I started my career journey with salaried jobs, then I added some legitimate side gigs to up my earnings. Enough to start my own business. 
      
      Naively, I believed that the moment I started my business, everything else would fall into place. I was in for a rude awakening! 
      
      Running a software development company for 7 years was intense, the challenges were endless! Tight deadlines, Last-minute defeats, name it.
      
      Was I making money from it? Yes but I desired more. To worsen matters, the immense stress was taking a toll on my health.
      
      I remember the thought of “bowing out” crossed my mind oftentimes, but because it was a path I chose for myself, I had to keep bearing my load. So to aid my health, I turned down a few juicy offers that came with strict deadlines, just to create some me-time: rest, recuperation, etc. But on the flip side, I had to deal with the consequences of declining those offers.
      
      I lost paychecks, referrals, and even a bit of my edge to competitors.
      
      Finally, it dawned on me to find a smarter way of earning more while still doing what I loved. I needed a lifetime stream of income that required little or no maintenance and would allow me to get my much-needed sleep.`,

      post2: `My research took me straight to real estate. Finally, an investment that ticked all the boxes. The next challenge was which real estate development company would I choose, I was about to hard-earned cash into a company I never met physically, and it must be a reputable one. I have trust issues, so it would take a sincere and reliable company to win my trust. 

      It was a long search indeed, but then I found Adozillion Homes & Realty. Not only did they tick all my boxes, and also the level of work done on the magnificent Mufasa Apartments project exceeds expectations and keeps to their word on delivering affordable plush Luxury homes to the smart elites. For me, it’s the huge Returns on my investment (ROIs). Steadily appreciating and never affected by the economy.
      
      Thanks to Mufasa Apartments developed by Adozillion Homes, I finally have a beautiful investment, in the heart of Ikate Lekki and now I feel like a true Boss while I’m still doing what I love though (I’m a Techie after all) and also go to bed without the fear of running out of cash flow.
      
      My investment is literally making money for me even when I sleep. What more could a guy want?
      
      Thank you Adozillion Homes & Realty. You are the real Boss.`,
